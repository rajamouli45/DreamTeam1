>Project Overview

Fable is a design prototype I created to explore how a sleek, modern interface can feel both smooth and intuitive. My main goal was to make the design visually appealing while keeping it simple and easy to navigate. I focused on clean layouts, consistent typography, and reusable components, all tied together with interactive navigation to create an engaging, user-friendly experience.

>Objectives & Goals

Seamless User Flow: I wanted users to move naturally between screens without confusion or friction.

Consistent Visuals: I carefully selected fonts, colors, and spacing to ensure the entire design feels cohesive and polished.

Reusable Components: By designing elements like buttons, cards, and headers for reuse, I saved time and maintained consistency across screens.

Interactive Prototype: Clickable buttons and scroll-based transitions make the prototype feel like a real, working app.

>Design Approach

Component-Based Layout: Building the design around reusable components made updates faster and kept everything uniform.

Dynamic Navigation: I used Figma’s prototype features to connect screens with click and scroll interactions, creating a more engaging flow.

Balanced Screen Design: Careful attention to alignment, spacing, and hierarchy ensures every screen looks clean and well-organized.

>Screens & Flow

Home / Landing Page: Features a strong hero section that introduces the site with a clear call-to-action.

Content Pages: Showcase features and detailed information in a clean, visually appealing way.

Back Navigation: Clear and simple navigation paths make it easy for users to return to previous screens.

Interactive Enhancements: Smooth scroll and click triggers make the overall navigation fluid and responsive.

>Key Learnings & Next Steps

This project gave me hands-on experience with Figma’s prototyping tools and taught me how to build with reusable components for a more efficient workflow. Moving forward, I plan to design responsive layouts, create mobile-friendly versions, and experiment with advanced transitions like overlays and nested flows to make the experience even more immersive.
