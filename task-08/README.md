>Flask acts as the bridge between your frontend (Next.js) and your database, allowing smooth, secure data exchange using APIs.

**1. What Flask Does**

Flask is a web framework — it lets you:

Create API endpoints (URLs) like /login, /users, /stories.

Connect those endpoints to Python functions that handle requests.

Interact with your database (MySQL or PostgreSQL).

Send data to your frontend (Next.js).

So basically:

>Frontend (Next.js) → sends a request → Flask handles it → talks to Database → sends response back.

**2. The Basic Flow**

Let’s understand it with a real example:

Step 1: Frontend Sends a Request

Your Fable website (Next.js) might need to show a list of stories.

Step 2: Flask Receives It

Step 3: Database Connection (Optional)

If you store data in a database, Flask uses SQLAlchemy to connect and fetch results

Step 4: Flask Sends a Response

Flask sends back a JSON response (structured data)

**3. How Flask Runs Internally**

Here’s what happens when you run python run.py:

Flask starts a local web server.

It listens for HTTP requests (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

When a request matches a defined route (@app.route), Flask runs that function.

The function might talk to the database or perform logic.

It returns a response (usually JSON).

Flask sends that response back to the browser or frontend.
